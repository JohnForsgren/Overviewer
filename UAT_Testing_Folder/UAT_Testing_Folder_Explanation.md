Idea here: 

Send the inpuit chat to a new AI and ask it to judge the current quality oif the current output based on the following: 
1. The input documentation / project documentation
2. A current output of the overviewer-app (i.e the whole folder structure with associated info)
3. A selection of examples of files from each of the mainfile types (.tsx, .scss, .xsl, etc)


Then ask for additional ideas of what can be done to provide more context
